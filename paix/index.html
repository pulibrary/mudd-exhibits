History of Paix et Libert&eacute;</b></P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> 
</P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In the fall of 1950, Jean-Paul David, mayor of Mantes, 
Deputy from Seine-et-Oise and Radical Socialist Party politician, created the 
organization Paix et Libert&eacute; in order to expose what he perceived as the 
Communist lies presented to the French public through propaganda distributed by 
the French Communist Party (Parti Communiste Fran&ccedil;ais, PCF). The PCF had 
developed an extremely successful billboard campaign using the 1949 drawing of 
Pablo Picasso's peace dove, which he created for the PCF's World Committee of 
Peace Partisans' conference held in Paris in the spring of 1949. The success of 
this poster in particular spurred David, with the support of Premier Ren&eacute; 
Pleven, to organize a semi-private, anti-Communist agency. This agency published 
and distributed posters supplemented by newsletters, brochures, pamphlets, stickers, 
and tracts that used the words, themes and symbols of the Communist Party to counter 
their message. In fact, the Paix et Libert&eacute; poster titled "The Dove that 
Goes Bang" redesigned Picasso's peace dove adorning the dove with a tank-turret 
for a head and a cannon for a beak. The posters also criticized several important 
figures within the PCF including Maurice Thorez, head of the PCF from 1930-1964, 
a minister of state under de Gaulle in 1945 and deputy premier in 1947 and Jacques 
Duclos and Marcel Cachin, both party members. Other posters criticized Lenin and 
Stalin. </P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Brief
