<P ALIGN="CENTER">Fiery New Exhibit Opens at Princeton University’s Mudd Library</P>
</B>
<P>Contentious political posters are common to many nations, but few are more explosive than a selection of French <I>affiches</I> on view at Princeton University’s Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library.  Entitled &quot;Paix et Libert&eacute;: Posters That Go BANG!,&quot; this colorful exhibit features seven posters, part of a thirty-five-poster collection that can be viewed in its entirety on the web.</P>

<P>Running from now until February 1, 2003, the exhibit showcases the work of the French anti-Communist organization Paix et Libert&eacute; (Peace and Liberty), which endeavored to combat what it regarded as the lies contained in Communist posters.  Founded by French politician Jean-Paul David in 1950 against the backdrop of a successful poster campaign by the French Communist Party, Paix et Libert&eacute; fought fire with fire by exploiting the themes, language, and symbols of its opponents’ posters.</P>

<P>The most powerful symbol that Paix et Libert&eacute; transformed was Pablo Picasso’s dove of peace, which the artist had created for a French Communist Party conference in 1949.  Visitors who tour the exhibit or its online counterpart can see the dove depicted as a threatening bomb or tank - a Trojan Horse of sorts - or as a victim, shot by a representative of the Soviet Union.  Its killer wields a gun in one hand and an olive branch in the other.</P>

<P>Other posters attack prominent members of the French Communist Party such as Maurice Thorez or Soviet leaders such as Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.  The Soviet Union was viewed as the patron of France’s Communists, injecting a note of foreign menace in the posters.  Taken as a whole, the posters underscore the harshness of France’s postwar political debate, as well as the ideological divisions that marked the Cold War.</P>

<P>&quot;Paix et Libert&eacute;: Posters that Go BANG!&quot; is open to the public 
  without charge Monday through Friday from 8:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. and, beginning 
  in September, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and until 8:00 p.m. on Wednesdays.
