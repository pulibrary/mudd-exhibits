This photograph shows the arrival James McCosh as president of Princeton
in 1868. In the nineteenth century Princeton students could choose from a
variety of photographs for the photograph albums and collections. This
image is a stereoscopic photograph that would be viewed using a
stereoscope.  Similar to a Viewmaster, the stereoscope would
create the
illusion of depth by presenting each eye with a separate image.
