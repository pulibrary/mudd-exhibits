  <p><strong>&quot;The Indispensable Chairman Flynn&quot; refers to Edward Flynn, 
    who stepped in to run FDR's campaign when James A. Farley, his campaign manager 
    in the 1932 and 1936 elections, refused to do so. Farley, a close friend from 
    the start of FDR's career, did not support FDR's bid for a third term but 
    allowed his own name to go before the Democratic convention in 1940. This 
    created a rift that lasted the rest of their lives, although Farley continued 
    to be close to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Like &quot;The Indispensable Chairman Flynn,&quot; &quot;Listening 
    for the Master's Voice&quot; refers to two members of the Democratic Party: 
    Farley and Paul McNutt, both of whom had a personal interest in FDR's decision 
    about a third term. However, neither man could act until he made his intentions 
    clear. The staging of this cartoon, with a Victrola, and the two men on their 
    hands and knees, recalls the iconic RCA Victor advertisement where a dog listens 
    to a recording of his master's voice. The cobwebs allude to the fact that 
    FDR did not make his decision quickly.</strong>
