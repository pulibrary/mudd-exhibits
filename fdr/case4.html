  <p><strong>Wendell Willkie was FDR's Republican opponent. He was a former Democrat 
    who fought against the New Deal, both in the courts and in the court of public 
    opinion. He also attacked FDR for a lack of military preparedness. However 
    when FDR expanded military contracts, Willkie accused him of war-mongering, 
    even though Willkie opposed the GOP's isolationist wing. In an effort to counteract 
    his image of being a Wall Street lawyer and industrialist, Willkie was often 
    pictured at his farms, though he never worked on the farms, having bought 
    them only as investments.<br>
