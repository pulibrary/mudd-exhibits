Mudd Manuscript Library. &quot;Testing Boundaries: Cartoon Visions of Roosevelt's Third Term&quot; highlights eleven cartoons from the Political Cartoon Collection that examine President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's quest for an unprecedented third term. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>On view from August 2 through January 31, 2005, &quot;Testing Boundaries: Cartoon Visions of Roosevelt's Third Term&quot;, follows the 1940 presidential nomination process as seen through the keen satirical eyes of the day's well known cartoonists. From the first mention of a possible third term with all sides questioning the wisdom of such a move through to the partisan debates, these cartoons show the issues in a light that can not easily be matched by text alone. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Despite serving two terms in office, FDR believed that he still had much to accomplish. He eventually decided to run for a third term, though he faced criticism from within his own party as well as from his Republican opponents. Some critics expressed concern that by breaking the two-term tradition established by George Washington, FDR would set a harmful precedent; others were concerned about the continuation of his &quot;New Deal&quot; policies or his foreign policy agenda.
