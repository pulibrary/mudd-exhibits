  <p><strong>After FDR won re-nomination, opponents charged that a third term 
    would imbue him with near-autocratic power. Leo Joseph Roche portrayed FDR 
    as a tyrannical king not subject to any checks of power, fearful this would 
    lead to the enslavement of a free people. In his almost three-dimensional 
    line drawing, Fred O. Seibel pointedly observed that &quot;The First President&quot; 
    not only disavowed a third term, but also warned against foreign entanglements, 
    a reference to the aid FDR provided Britain in the war in Europe. </strong></p>
