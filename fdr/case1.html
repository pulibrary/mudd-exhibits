  <p align="left"><strong>The political atmosphere leading up to the Democratic 
    National Convention in 1940 was tense. Many wondered if President Franklin 
    Delano Roosevelt would seek an unprecedented third term and, if he did, would his 
    party and the country support him. These cartoons provide a window into that 
    moment in history before FDR sought and won his third (and subsequently a 
    fourth) term in the White House. In them, they illustrate and lampoon FDR's 
    decision-making process, the wisdom of a third term, the conflict within the 
    Democratic party and their clash with their Republican opponents, possible 
    foreign perspectives, and finally, an examination of the essential legitimacy 
    of the campaign for a third term.</strong></p>
  <p><strong><strong>Despite two terms in office, FDR believed that he still had much 
    to accomplish. However, as we can see in Rube Goldberg's cartoon &quot;The 
    Easter Bonnet,&quot; it was not clear to the party, and thus the country, 
    if he was in fact going to run. Ross A. Lewis, in his &quot;Fuel For a Fireside 
    Chat&quot; asks questions that reflect the public's wariness of allowing FDR 
    a third term. The title refers to FDR's popular radio addresses that were 
    meant to inform and reassure the public. </strong><br>
