        memorial to Princeton alumni who gave their lives in World War II was 
        displayed for the first time at Washington’s Birthday exercises at Princeton 
        University on February 22, 1946. The memorial was placed on display in 
        Memorial Hall in Nassau Hall, where it sat on a red, white and blue silk 
        draped table. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Each page of the memorial 
        contains the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Emudd/databases/warbook.html">name, 
        branch of service, and place and date</a></font> <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Emudd/databases/warbook.html"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">of 
        death of each Princeton man to die in World War II</font></a><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">, 
        as well as the Princeton shield and the same Latin inscription used in 
        the World War I memorial panels in Nassau Hall. When translated, it reads, 
        &quot;Alma Mater keeps in eternal memory her sons who laid down their 
        lives for their country.&quot; A page was added each time a death was 
        announced, and a duplicate of the page was given to the family of the 
        fallen man. Within each war year, names are listed in chronological order 
        by date of death, and each year of the war is designated by a bookmark 
        of orange silk attached to an orange and black sheet. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Jean Labutut, a Princeton 
        architecture professor, conceived and designed the memorial as a &quot;sacred 
        archive&quot; to express the deep sympathy and high regard of Princeton 
        for her sons. At the time it was displayed, 329 Princeton men were known 
        dead, a ratio of one death to every thirty Princetonians in service. Later, 
        the number increased to 355. In its exhibit in Memorial Hall, the combination 
        of Princeton’s colors in the book, the colors of the American flag, and 
        the surrounding memorial panels recognizing all of Princeton’s war dead 
        pointedly characterized the motto &quot;Princeton in the Nation’s Service.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="warbook.jpg" width=400 height=162 align="left" alt="Warbook close-up">Each 
        part of the memorial, from its bronze cover to the bookmarks separating 
        pages by year of the war, is symbolic of some aspect of World War II and 
        Princeton’s relationship to the war. The bronze cover reflects the long, 
        hard struggle of war. The simplicity of the design as well as the weight 
        of the cover suggests modern warfare and the important parts armor played 
        in the war. The effort required to lift the cover is a reminder of the 
        war’s difficult battles. The hinge and three bolts are three crosses, 
        rising from the dark and irregular texture and color of the cover. They 
        intentionally resemble landmarks hurriedly erected on the battlefield. 
        These temporary crosses reflect the temporary nature of the memorial and 
        symbolize the ultimate sacrifice made by the Princetonians whose names 
        are listed within the memorial. During 2002, the 60th anniversary of America’s 
        first full year of involvement in the Second World War, this book will 
        be displayed at the Frist Campus Center and one page will be turned each 
        day to honor and commemorate all who served in the conflict.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>This exhibit is sponsored 
        by the Princeton University Development Office and the University Archives. 
        Ultimately, the memorial book will return to its home in the Princeton 
        University Archives at the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library. </i></font></p>
