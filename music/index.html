      <p>Singing has a long tradition at Princeton University. Original songs 
        written by Princeton students and alumni go back at least two centuries. 
        In 1869, three undergraduates, George K. Ward (Class of 1869), A. Bailey 
        Kelly (Class of 1870), and John C. Pennington (Class of 1871) compiled 
        the first <i>Carmina Princetonia</i>, a collection of 77 songs &quot;peculiar 
        to Princeton.&quot; The tradition of publishing <i>Carmina Princetonia</i> 
        continues to this day, in addition to campus and class songbooks. </p>
      <p>In this online exhibition we provide the music in sound and print of 
        famous Princeton songs: the Alma Mater '<a href="#song1">Old Nassau</a>', 
        '<a href="#song2">The Orange and the Black</a>', '<a href="#song3">The 
        Princeton Cannon Song</a>' and '<a href="#going">Going Back to Nassau 
        Hall</a>'.</p>

      <h3>Old Nassau</h3>
	  <p><i>Old Nassau</i> is the Alma Mater of Princeton University, sung at 
        every University celebration and reunion. Harlan Page Peck, Class of 1862, 
        sent the lyrics to the <i>Nassau Literary Magazine </i>in 1859, winning 
        the magazine's prize for the best college song. The song was originally 
        set to the tune of <i>Auld Lang Syne</i> until a German tutor, Karl A. 
        Langlotz, wrote the music later in 1859.  (His violin is found in
the University Archives' <a

      <h3>The Orange and the Black</h3>
      <p>The first recorded use of Princeton's colors occurred in 1867, when the 
        Class of 1869 Base Ball Club wore badges of orange ribbon with black printing 
        provided by George K. Ward (Class of 1869). In 1874 the colors were worn 
        during an intercollegiate rowing regatta in Saratoga and thereafter also 
        by athletic teams. In 1888 the song <i>The Orange and the Black</i> followed, 
        written by Clarence B. Mitchell, (Class of 1889) to a tune arranged by 
        Ernest Carter (Class of 1888). It soon won a place in Princeton lore. 
        At the left the sheet music of another <i>Orange and Black</i> written 
        by A. Willis Hunt and published in 1897 as a march and two-step without 
        lyrics.

      <h3>The Princeton Cannon Song</h3>
      <p>The Princeton Cannon Song was created in 1906 by J.F. Hewitt and A.H. 
        Osborn, both of the Class of 1907, and dedicated to their class. The front 
        page of the first edition of the Princeton Cannon Song (shown at the right) 
        reads:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>The &quot;cannon&quot; is a revolutionary relic planted muzzle down 
          on the campus. Football victories over traditional rivals are celebrated 
          around it by the light of a huge bonfire, for which the Freshman Class 
          supplies the fuel.</i> </p>

      <h3>Going Back to Nassau Hall</h3>
      <p>After <i>Old Nassau</i>, <i>Going Back to Nassau Hall</i> is one of the 
        most popular Princeton songs. Kenneth Sherman Clark, Class of 1905, wrote 
        it in 1910 as a reunion song. Clark authored songs and music for the Triangle 
        Club, and composed athletic cheers and tributes such as <i>The Scoreboard 
        Song</i>, and <i>Princeton Hockey Song. </i>He also wrote several well-known 
        Princeton songs including<i> The Princeton Jungle March </i>and <i>Princeton 
        Forward March to Victory. </i> In 1944 he was awarded a varsity letter 
        for his musical contributions to the Department of Athletics. Clark was 
        the first non-athlete to receive this distinction.
