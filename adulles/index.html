    <td width="410">Allen W. Dulles was instrumental in shaping U.S. intelligence operations.
    He began his career during World War II in the Office of Strategic Services, serving in
    Bern, Switzerland, and after the war, he chaired an intelligence review committee that was
    critical of the fledgling Central Intelligence Agency. Soon afterward Dulles was appointed
    Deputy Director of Plans at CIA and quickly rose to the number two position. After Dwight
    D. Eisenhower&#146;s election in 1952, Dulles was appointed Director of CIA, serving until
    1961. The photo on the right depicts President John F. Kennedy awarding Dulles the
    National Security Medal November 28, 1961 at the new CIA headquarters in Langley,
    Virginia.</td>
