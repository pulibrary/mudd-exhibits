<p ALIGN="CENTER">Address by ALLEN W. DULLES<br>
Director of Central Intelligence<br>
before the<br>
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS 64TH CONGRESS OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY<br>
Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York City<br>
4 December 1959, 1:30 p.m., EST</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelve years ago, on December 3, 1947, I had
the honor of addressing the 52nd Annual Congress of American Industry, held by your
Association.&nbsp; My subject on that occasion, as now, was, the Soviet Challenge.&nbsp; I
then stated that this was a challenge to the United States &quot;to prove that the system
of free men under law can survive.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is still a challenge.&nbsp; Only a few
weeks ago Khrushchev amiably advised us, as he left the United States, that Communism
would in time take us over.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1947 the Soviets were basing their hopes
-- not so much on the economic and industrial might of their own system, as on their
forecast of the imminent collapse of our free enterprise society.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it was Stalin, Molotov and Vishinsky
who warned us and told the world that our Marshall Plan was merely a means of unloading
excess commodities and capital to avoid an impending American crisis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These old Soviet leaders have gone and so
have gone many of their arguments.&nbsp; Their successors have largely abandoned the
thesis of an early demise of capitalism due to its own defects.&nbsp; Now they boast that
over the years, say by 1970, they will surpass us in total industrial output.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a boast which is not likely to be
realized unless we &quot;rest on our oars.&quot;&nbsp; What is of more immediate concern
to us is the fact that the Soviets are using their growing industrial strength, which is
still less than one-half of our own, largely to promote their national power aims rather
than to give a fuller life to their own people.&nbsp; We are doing just the opposite. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A decade ago Moscow was speaking to us in
threatening terms because we were giving aid overseas to meet the danger of economic
breakdown and communist takeover in large parts of Europe.&nbsp; Now they propose to
compete with us on a worldwide basis in the field of overseas aid and trade, hoping to win
over the uncommitted nations of the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, though they had no atomic bombs, the
Soviet were using the threat of their great conventional forces to help undermine Greece
and Turkey and then later to menace the Free World in Berlin and Korea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, while they preach coexistence and
economic and industrial competition with the West, they also, on occasions, this week in
fact, rattle the threat of ballistic missiles and give their support to the &quot;hard
core&quot; Communists in their uneasy European satellites.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As representatives of this 64th Congress of
American Industry, you have a legitimate interest in what your most aggressive foreign
competitor, the Sino-Soviet Bloc, is doing and planning.&nbsp; Today this is not because
this competitor is seriously threatening your domestic or even your foreign markets.
&nbsp; It is rather because the pattern of this competitor's conduct and the impact of the
Bloc's growing industrial power may have an important influence on the future direction of
American industry and of our economy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wise European remarked to me the other day
that in his opinion, the danger of war had receded, but that the dangers from
international communism in other fields had increased.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In saying this he had two major thoughts in
mind:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First, that the military situation would become a nuclear stalemate, the United States
with its allies and the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sino-Soviet Bloc
each having a sufficient supply of nuclear weapons and the means of delivery to inflict
unacceptable damage on the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Second that, under these conditions, the competition might shift, at least for a time,
from the military to the political and economic sectors with the Free World and free
enterprise competing for the uncommitted world against all forms of penetration
international communism.&nbsp; Such competition, short of war, is the more likely because
Khrushchev, while he desires to inherit the earth, does not wish it to be a world
devastated (sic) by nuclear weapons, -- also he thinks he is doing quite well as events
are now developing.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not require recourse in secret data
to reach the following conclusion: That over the immediate future both the United States
and the Soviet Union will be continuing to equip themselves with nuclear weapons and with
the means of delivery, whether by guided missiles or aircraft, adequate to constitute a
grave deterrent to war by either side.&nbsp; The impact of this mutual growing capability
is already having its effect on the international scene.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for the deterrent to be effective,
other conditions must be met; among them are the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The United States and its allies of the
Free World must continue to maintain a military defensive and retaliatory power such that
no increase in Sino-Soviet military power could lead the latter to believe that they had
gained clear superiority over us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Regional strife among powers having no
nuclear capabilities must be quarantined or limited.&nbsp; History has shown us small wars
breed great wars and chain reactions with unforeseen consequences may result from them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) There must be no doubt in the minds
either of the leaders in Moscow or Peiping that the initiation by them of a war of
aggression would be met with adequate force.&nbsp; Hence we must make the strength of our
military position, and our readiness to use it in defense against communist aggression, so
clear that there can be no misunderstanding on the part of the Soviet.&nbsp; Some wars
have come from vicious intent and were a calculated act; more have come from
miscalculations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I doubt whether the leaders of international
communism misunderstand or miscalculate our posture today.&nbsp; They must <u>not</u> do
so tomorrow.&nbsp; The prevention of misunderstanding is a continuing task.&nbsp; We must
not slip into an attitude of complacency which might lead the Communists to have doubts
about our intentions.&nbsp; They must not be allowed to feel that the threat of nuclear
blackmail could be used to push us out of any position that is vital to our security, on
the mistaken theory that it is not worth the risk of a nuclear conflict. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the Soviets with a Gross National
Product and an industrial capacity less than one-half of ours are nevertheless allocating
to the national power sector of their economy, including military hardware and industrial
plant for war purposes, an effort roughly equivalent to ours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they continue their industrial growth
rate, at some eight to nine per cent per annum as is likely, the Soviets will be able, if
they choose, substantially to increase their military effort.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly until a system of controlled
disarmament is devised, we cannot safely relax in the field of our military strength as
the primary deterrent to the danger of communist aggression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secret of Soviet economic progress is
simple.&nbsp; They plow back into investment a large and growing share of their total
annual production.&nbsp; The Kremlin leaders direct about 30 per cent of GNP into capital
outlays, while we in the United States are content with 17 - 20 per cent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commanding role of investment in Soviet
economic growth is dramatically illustrated by their Seven Year Plan, which runs through
1965.&nbsp; Capital investment in industry for the year 1959, the initial year of the
plan, will be approximately equal, measured in dollars, to industrial investment in the
United States.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the Soviets absolute volume of
investment in such productive areas as the iron, steel and nonferrous industries, as well
as in machinery manufacturing, will be substantially greater than that of the United
States.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These massive investment expenditures are
being fed into an industrial system whose output in 1958 was only about 40 per cent of the
United States.&nbsp; Under such high pressure fueling, the Soviet industrial plant can
hardly fail to grow considerably faster than that of the United States.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to the consumers field, the picture
is entirely different.&nbsp; While they have been slightly increasing the production of
consumer goods over the past few years, their consuming public fares badly in comparison
with our own.&nbsp; In 1958, Soviet citizens had available for purchase about one-third of
the total goods and services available to Americans.&nbsp; For example, the Soviets were
then producing on an average one automobile for every 50 we produced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there are no adequate figures to
compare our production of luxury goods with that of the Soviet, it is certainly true that
here Soviet production would only be a small percentage of our own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly it is true that a major thrust of
our economy is directed into the production of the consumer type of goods and services,
which add little to the sinews of our national strength.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
major thrust of Soviet economic development, and its high technological skills and
resources, are directed toward specialized industrial, military and national power goals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a contestant engaged in a vital economic
race with a lean and well-muscled opponent, we persist in carrying a prodigious burden of
fat on our backs.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soviet postwar economic expansion, as well
as its advances in the military field, have also permitted the Kremlin to adopt an
aggressive program in the less developed countries of the Free World.&nbsp; In these newly
emergent and fragile nations, the Soviet leaders have been advancing their cause by a
combination of economic penetration, political warfare, and subversion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic strategy of international
communism, with its primary emphasis on measures short of war, has remained remarkably
unchanged since the death of Stalin.&nbsp; So too have its objectives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were never more bluntly stated than in
Khrushchev's recent speeches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously referring to the phrase attributed
to him, &quot;We will bury you,&quot; he explained last summer that when he said that
communism would be the graveyard of capitalism, he did not mean that communists would take
shovels and start digging; &quot;History,&quot; he said, &quot;would take care of
capitalists.&quot;&nbsp; They too, he suggested, would become museum pieces, and added
that, &quot;If there were a God and he could act, he would take a good broom and sweep you
out.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us have a look at the brooms Khrushchev
proposes to use.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>First</u> economic penetration of the
uncommitted world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick industrialization is the goal of the
new and emerging countries, as well as of many of the older countries which have been
backward industrially.&nbsp; It is no answer to such aspirations to suggest that the type
of industrialization they want is premature, unwise or over-costly.&nbsp; They will
continue to seek it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The example of the Soviet Union attracts
them.&nbsp; Here they see a nation which, in the course of 30 years since their
revolutionary growing pains ended about 1928, has achieved second place in the world
industrially. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newly emerging States want results.
&nbsp; The want them now.&nbsp; The Soviet promise them the moon with a few Migs thrown
in.&nbsp; They understand full well that the Soviets first got a rocket to the moon and
some of them are deluded by the belief that the Kremlin can also give them a painless
industrial transformation.&nbsp; Soviet propaganda tells them this is so and that
communism will deliver the goods.&nbsp; It is a potent argument.&nbsp; You can expect to
see the Soviets continuing to use it in the four corners of the earth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In several cases they have been able to get
the jump on us; partly because of the procedures required under our laws; partly because
we, rightly, have never conceived this to be a competition to see who can give the most
the quickest but rather how one can best contribute to sound economic growth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Soviets, abetted by the Chinese
Communists and their European Satellites, can easily maintain their present level of aid
and trade and in the coming decade they may well divert larger absolute amounts to woo the
uncommitted areas of the world.&nbsp; As the Soviet and Chinese Communist industrial
production advances, the threat of the spread of communism through trade and aid into
uncommitted areas of the world will be proportionately increased.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another broom which international communism
proposes to use against the Free World is political warfare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here they have an aggressive campaign based
on a series of very positive programs with political, economic and cultural objectives.
&nbsp; It involves the radio and other means of mass communication, as well as the written
and spoken word; subtle political intrigue based on the control and manipulation of
communist parties and communist fronts on a worldwide basis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It includes the use of various
&quot;cover&quot; organizations which pretend to represent youth, labor, professional
groups and veterans.&nbsp; They become the agencies for spreading communist doctrine
throughout the Free World.&nbsp; In their subversive arsenal, they also have organizations
which use the slogans of &quot;peace,&quot; friendship and coexistence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This challenge is being pressed forward
under the growing threat of Soviet industrial, scientific and technical advances and under
the cover of the Kremlin's posture of coexistence.&nbsp; It is a challenge which is the
more dangerous because it is cleverly and clandestinely conducted, and even the Communist
role is concealed as far as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet this threat we must understand it.
&nbsp; To penetrate the subtleties of the Soviet political, economic, and psychological
drive is harder to do than to understand the military threat.&nbsp; Weapons of war are
visible, tangible, and comprehensible.&nbsp; The impact of an idea, of a subversive
political movement, of a disguised economic policy is more subtle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International communism is a ruthlessly
proselytizing force.&nbsp; It seeks to make converts of men and women wherever the
opportunity permits; just as it does not hesitate to make &quot;prisoners&quot; of them as
it has done in Hungary.&nbsp; It has lost none of its faith in its worldwide mission, as
outlined by Lenin and Stalin and vigorously proclaimed by Khrushchev as he left our shores
a few weeks ago.&nbsp; This mission continues to be the domination of the entire Free
World, with primary emphasis today on the new and uncommitted nations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The communists have no reason to be
confident that they have an adequate answer to our military retaliatory power.&nbsp; They
do feel, however, that they still have the ability to close off their own frontiers, their
air space and their rigidly controlled society to ideas from abroad.&nbsp; They have their
Iron Curtains not only on their frontiers but within the country.&nbsp; They even try to
draw down this Curtain within the minds of their own people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently we see some evidence here and there
of a slight raising of their curtain.&nbsp; There is somewhat less jamming and a wider
play of American news items in the Soviet press.&nbsp; If this were to continue and
develop it would be one of the most encouraging signs in our relations with the USSR.
&nbsp; It would be an act, a deed on their part, as contrasted with mere pronouncements
about coexistence.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third broom the Soviets have been subtly
using against us is the penetration and subversion of governments which do not
&quot;cooperate&quot; with Moscow or Peiping.&nbsp; A classical example here was
Czechoslovakia, more than ten years ago.&nbsp; The same techniques are used today. &nbsp;
Popular front governments are still being planned by Moscow for several countries which
today have close relations with us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nationalism&quot; as a slogan for the
breaking of the ties of friendship between us and the countries of this Hemisphere was the
line given the Latin American communist leaders who attended the 21st Party Congress in
Moscow last February.&nbsp; Details for the execution of this policy were then outlined to
these leaders and some of the fruits of this planning can be seen today in Panama, Cuba,
and elsewhere in this Hemisphere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is Moscow's desire to move very secretly
in this field and not to allow its hand to be shown as directly supporting local Communist
parties either in this Hemisphere or elsewhere.&nbsp; Recently Peiping has not been so
subtle.&nbsp; The Chinese Communists, who have the same long-range objectives as the
Soviets, are acting in their own area of particular interest with a heavy, blundering
hand.&nbsp; In fact, nationalistic feeling has been turning <u>against</u> Peiping in many
countries around the periphery of Communist China.&nbsp; This must make the more
professional operators in the Kremlin cringe.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these comments, I have tried to give some
idea of the nature and dimensions of the Soviet challenge in the military, political, and
economic fields.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My conclusion is that even if a nuclear
stalemate should tend to lessen the immediate danger of war, we would still be faced with
a serious challenge.&nbsp; Furthermore, if, over the years the Soviet military outlays
should take up a smaller ratio than today of their Gross National Product, the Kremlin
might give added emphasis to its non-military penetration program.&nbsp; This would add to
the danger of its policies under &quot;peaceful coexistence&quot; as the Kremlin now
preaches it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly we have not answered the challenge
if we limit ourselves merely to meeting the Kremlin's military threat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These facts should bring us to a sober
appraisal of the best means of marshalling our very great assets and capabilities -- in
concert with our like-minded friends and allies.&nbsp; Today the Free World has a wide
margin of industrial superiority over the Communist world.&nbsp; Are we applying this
superiority in the proper way to the proper ends?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This we must do within the framework of
freedom - not regimentation as practiced in the Soviet Union. It must be done with due
regard for the legitimate aspirations of our people for a fuller life - not by asking them
to accept the drab existence imposed on the Soviet people.&nbsp; However, as Mr. Herter
said, the fateful competition with communism has a first claim on our energies and our
interests and calls for subordination of our private interests to the paramount public
interest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, yourselves, with your wide interests
and responsibilities could do much to help make this society of ours become more
responsive to the challenge of the day.&nbsp; </p>
