  new exhibit at Princeton University's Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library commemorates 
  the 300th anniversary of the birth of the American theologian and philosopher 
  Jonathan Edwards. The exhibit features a large portrait, 14 books, and 15 documents 
  from the Princeton University Library's Department of Rare Books and Special 
  Collections. Running from July 21, 2003 through February 1, 2004, the exhibit 
  chronicles Edwards's life as a preacher, leader of the religious revival known 
  as the Great Awakening, and the third president of the College of New Jersey, 
  as Princeton University was known in his day. Overall, the exhibit captures 
  the religious fervor of the 18th century and Edwards's influential role in shaping 
  it. </font></p>
