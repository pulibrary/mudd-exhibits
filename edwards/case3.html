    to Jonathan Sergeant, Treasurer of the College of New Jersey, February 28, 
    1758</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the few letters 
    written by Edwards during the five weeks he served as president of the College 
    of New Jersey, as Princeton University was known prior to 1896. Three days 
    after the death of Aaron Burr, who had served as president of the college 
    since 1748, the trustees chose Edwards to succeed his son-in-law. After much 
    consideration and urging from ministers, Edwards accepted the position and 
    was installed as president in Nassau Hall on February 16, 1758. This letter 
    was written only twelve days after his installation. Edwards wrote to Jonathan 
    Sergeant, treasurer of the college, seeking an advance on his stipend for 
    the month of March, and in addition, a loan of 100 pounds. The letter reflects 
    a concern that Edwards had earlier expressed to his widowed daughter Mrs. 
    Aaron Burr, when he had written to her some weeks earlier: &quot;I know I 
    can't live at Princeton, as a President must, on the salary they offer: - 
    yet I have left the matter to their [the Trustees'] generosity. I shall have 
    no money wherewith to furnish the house&#133;&quot; <i><font size="2">(Manuscript

    to an untimely death, he left his enduring mark as a religious leader and

    Hall, c. 1880</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hall commemorates 
    Princeton University's third president, Jonathan Edwards. It was built in 
    1880 at the behest of President McCosh to fill &quot;the clamant want&quot; 
    of a &quot;new and plain dormitory to provide cheap rooms for ... struggling 
    students,&quot; and &quot;to reduce the number of freshmen compelled to live 
    beyond our walls and under no tutorial inspection&quot; (Trustee Minutes, 
    June 16, 1879). In the 1880s and 1890s the hall had a reputation for &quot;plain 
    living and high thinking&quot; and for a time was known as &quot;Poler's Paradise.&quot; 
    The hall's architect was Prior and West; its donor was John Cleve Green. <font size="2"><i>(University
