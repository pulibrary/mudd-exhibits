  <p align="left">From 1726 to 1750       Edwards served as the pastor of the Third Church in Northampton, the largest       and most influential church outside of Boston. This       particular letter was addressed to Edwards's fellow minister and former pupil,       the Reverend Joseph Bellamy, of Bethlehem, Connecticut. Written during the       Great Awakening, at a time when Edwards was preaching some of his most famous       revival sermons, such as <em>A       Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God</em> (1736) and <em>Sinners       in the Hands of an Angry God</em> (1741), the       letter faithfully reflects Edwards's preoccupations and labors at this very       active moment in his career. Edwards wrote to other fellow ministers, such       as Moses Lyman of Goshen, Connecticut, to counsel against preaching false       doctrines.

The Nature of True Virtue, by       the late Reverend, Learned and Pious, Jonathan Edwards, President of the College       of New Jersey, 1765</strong><br>
After twenty-three years, Edwards's ministry at Northampton came to a close       as a result of the theological controversy between him and his people concerning       the terms of Christian communion. On June 2, 1750, a Council of Churches voted       that the relation between pastor and people be dissolved. Edwards remained       in Northampton for over a year, occasionally preaching there by request, considering       plans for the future, and making several exploratory visits to Stockbridge       where he had been invited to take charge of the Housatonic Indian mission       and the church. Many feared that Edwards would remain and establish a "distinct       and separate congregation," as some of his friends were urging him to       do. With the advice of an ecclesiastical council, Edwards decided to leave       Northampton and accept the call to Stockbridge. He was formally installed       on August 8, 1751. During his time at Stockbridge, Edwards wrote these treatises       that brought him fame as a great American philosopher and theologian. <em>(University       Archives)</em><br>

  Edwards wrote this letter the year after he moved to Stockbridge. Burr was       serving as president of the College of New Jersey at this time. The letter       emphasizes the close bonds that linked Edwards to like-minded ministers in       other parts of America and in England and Scotland. The "great design"       of the College of New Jersey is the principal subject of Edwards's letter       to Burr. The promoters of the college were looking towards their brethren       abroad for help, and various plans for a fundraising tour were being discussed.       Burr was among those being mentioned as a possible leader of such a mission. <em>(Manuscript Division, Jonathan Edwards Collection)</em></font></p>
