  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edwards was born on       October 5, 1703, in East Windsor, Connecticut into a Puritan evangelical household.       His father, the Reverend Timothy Edwards, was a Congregational minister. His       mother, Esther Stoddard, was the daughter of the Reverend Solomon Stoddard       of Northampton, Massachusetts. Edwards was the only boy in a family of eleven.       Educated at home by his parents and sisters, he entered Yale College in 1716,       graduating in 1720. He continued his studies in theology, receiving a Master       of Arts in 1723. (left: Mrs. H.M. Plunkett, “Ten Co-Educated Girls Two Hundred Years Ago," Scribner’s Magazine, April 1903, p. 453.</font>)</p>

  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1726 Edwards went to the Congregational church at Northampton as an assistant       to his grandfather, the Reverend Solomon Stoddard. He was ordained early in       1727 and in the same year married Sarah Pierpont of New Haven. Together they       had eleven children-three sons and eight daughters. His son Jonathan Edwards,       Jr. followed in his father's footsteps, studying theology and ultimately becoming       a preacher in Connecticut. Below is a front page from one of Jonathan Edwards,       Jr.'s sermons:"Sermon X, 1767, Nassau Hall, Preached at Trenton, Bethlehem,       New Haven, Danbury, Princeton, and Elis Town."
