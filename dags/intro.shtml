            In the spring of 2000, the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library at Princeton 
            University received a grant from the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rbsc/friends/" target="_blank">Friends 
            of the Princeton University Library</a> to assist with the preservation 
            of cased photographic images in the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/search/photos.html" target="_blank">Historical 
            Photograph Collection</a> in the University Archives. This grant was 
            supplemented by a gift from Princeton University alumnus, Alexander 
            D. Stuart, Class of 1972. The goals of this project were to stabilize, 
            clean, and rehouse the cased images, ensuring their availability for 
            research in the Mudd Library for years to come. </p>
          <p>Daguerreotypes and ambrotypes, two of the earliest photographic processes, 
            are unique, rare, and valuable images. The daguerreotype process, 
            in which a single positive image is reproduced on a copper plate coated 
            with silver, dates from 1839 and was popular until around 1860. The 
            ambrotype process, in which a single positive collodion-based image 
            is developed on a glass plate, dates from 1855 to 1865. While the 
            Historical Photograph Collection in the Princeton University Archives 
            contains approximately 20,000 paper photographic prints from the 1860s 
            to the present, there are only 77 daguerreotypes and ambrotypes in 
            the collection. These images, dating from the 1840s through the 1850s, 
            are the only extant photographic images to document the late antebellum 
            period at Princeton University. The condition of the cased images 
            before their preservation treatment was such that they could not be 
            safely handled; with the completion of this project researchers may 
            now come to the Mudd Library to study this valuable collection. This 
            online exhibition highlights a small number of the images that were 
            a part of this project. </p>
