          <p>John Buhler and Walter Turnbull Scott, both from Mississippi, were 
            cousins and students at the College of New Jersey during the first 
            years of daguerreotypy. Buhler kept a diary that he titled <i>My Microscope</i> 
            documenting his experiences as a student. In it he wrote about seeing 
            the first daguerreotype portraits of himself taken by the New York 
            photographer George Prosch, who had set up a studio in Princeton for 
            several weeks.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            &quot;It was a curiosity to see the images that were taken of me 
              this morning - all looking like Heroes in High Tragedy. Never saw 
              such infernally fierce looking countenances in my life &amp; Prosch 
              said, that neither did he ever see such.&quot;</blockquote>
            <p>Other sessions with Prosch resulted in happier results, and Buhler 
              wrote how &quot;glorious&quot; it would be &quot;to have the 'counterfeit 
              presentaments' of these good friends of mine stamped visibly thus 
              - a tangible memento &amp; a constant which shall bring their old 
              selves continually to my Sight as they are ever present before my 
              Memory! <u>That</u>, shall treasure up the delightful associations 
              which were born in our pleasant Communion - the kindly associations 
              of Mind &amp; Heart! The Picture shall reproduce ever, the substantial 
              images of their Forms &amp; Faces! Memory shall call up and limn- 
              the graphic shadows of our Intercourse - Sight shall clothe the 
              Shade in Sunshine and Light!!&quot;</p>
          
          <p>Clearly Buhler continued in his desire to have &quot;tangible mementos&quot; 
            of his &quot;delightful association&quot; - this triple portrait was 
            taken of Buhler, his new wife Mary, and his cousin Walter, probably 
            on the occasion of the marriage of Buhler and Mary. </p>
