          <h2>Dry Clean Conservation Technique </h2>
          <p>All of the daguerreotypes in the University Archives were dry cleaned. 
            The conservator removed the daguerreotype from its housing and cleaned 
            the plate using compressed air from an ear syringe, which loosened 
            and removed any debris from the surface of the plate. The cover glass 
            was cleaned, the plate and glass were resealed, and the preserver 
            (if there was one) was replaced. The package was then put back into 
            its case, or if the case had been lost a new enclosure was made.</p>
          <p> Despite the fact that the two daguerreotypes featured here number 
            among the earliest examples in the University Archives, both have 
            survived in very good condition. Each retains its original case and 
            required only the minimum conservation treatment. </p>

          <p>This daguerreotype, possibly the earliest example in the University 
            Archives, has previously been thought to be of the Class of 1843. 
            It presents many puzzles to the present-day viewer, however. No definitive 
            identifications have been made for the 35 sitters or the daguerreotypist 
            and the building in which the men sat for their portrait is unknown, 
            but we may speculate. There were 63 members of the Class of 1843, 
            and at that time there were seven buildings on campus - only three 
            of which had rooms large enough for 35 people; two of these were Whig 
            and Clio Hall, home of the two debating societies on campus. This 
            image may present members of one of these societies. Some of the men 
            appear to be older, and may be faculty members or tutors. The rest 
            are undoubtedly students, their faces young and expectant as they 
            face the camera. The photographer may have been George Prosch, a New 
            York daguerreotypist known to have worked in Princeton during the 
            early 1840s, taking portraits of students, faculty, and Princeton 
            Borough residents, as well as assisting <a href="henry.shtml">Professor 
            of Natural Philosophy Joseph Henry</a> with his experiments using 
            daguerreotype plates. <a name="dryanchor">&nbsp;</a></p>
