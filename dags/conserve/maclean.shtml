          <p>These three daguerreotype portraits of George Macintosh Maclean and 
            his son John were taken within a year's time of each other. It is 
            almost certain that the second two were taken by the same photographer, 
            perhaps at the same session, while the first was taken at another 
            time -- perhaps earlier, for John Maclean appears to be slightly younger. 
            Other details distinguish this portrait from the other two: The light 
            background, the book the father has open on the table, the pen he 
            holds, and the gold paint highlighting the buttons of young John Maclean's 
            jacket. </p>

          <p>The pose of all three daguerreotypes is remarkably similar, and suggests 
            the conscious choice by father and son of this pose. In each portrait 
            the father sits with a book or sheaf of paper in hand, and gazes directly 
            at the viewer. His son stands at the right with his eyes lowered and 
            his hand resting on his father's shoulder. While allegorical compositions 
            of youth and age were common, and the conceit of holding a book or 
            writing was meant as an indication of intellectual or scholarly pursuits, 
            no precedent has been located for a pose of this exact type. Perhaps 
            it is meant to show the father as his son's teacher - the boy may 
            be looking down at what is written on the paper or book his father 
            holds - or his lowered eyes may simply indicate a measure of respect.
