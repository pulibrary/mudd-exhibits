          <h2>Conservation Techniques</h2>
          <p>The daguerreotypes and ambrotypes in the Princeton University Archives 
            underwent various levels of conservation depending on their condition. 
            Most of the ambrotypes and a number of the daguerreotypes were in 
            good repair and required only basic stabilization -- a minimum of 
            cleaning and the creation of new protective enclosures in which to 
            store the images. </p>
          <p>A number of daguerreotypes, however, required more intensive treatment. 
            Over time the seals around many of the daguerreotype packages weakened 
            and allowed air and moisture to come in contact with the silver coated 
            copper plate. This caused the surface to darken, corrode, and become 
            embedded with debris. In some cases the glass protecting the plate 
            had deposits of corrosion. Additionally, previous attempts at cleaning 
            the daguerreotypes -- through cyanide or thiourea, for example -- 
            often caused irreparable damage to the plates. </p>
          <p>All of the daguerreotypes receiving conservation treatment were first 
            cleaned using the <a href="dry.shtml">dry method</a>, their glass 
            cleaned, and resealed. Two groups of daguerreotypes required further 
            treatment. One group, with only minimum corrosion or accretions, was 
            bathed in a <a href="water.shtml">water wash</a>. Another group, requiring 
            more intensive treatment, was <a href="electro.shtml">electro-cleaned</a>. 
            The following sections describe each of these treatments, and some 
            show &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; examples of treated 
            daguerreotypes. </p>
          <p>It cannot be stressed enough that these images were treated by a 
            professional photograph conservator. Much of the earlier damage to 
            these images was caused by untrained individuals who attempted to 
            clean or conserve the daguerreotypes themselves. For information on 
            finding a qualified conservator, individuals are urged to contact 
            the <a href="http://aic.stanford.edu" target="_blank">American Institute 
            of Conservators</a> or an archive in their area. </p>
