          <p>With the electro-cleaning treatment these nine Princeton students 
            emerged from the haze of corrosion behind which they were hidden for 
            over a century. While the images do not appear as pristine as they 
            did in 1853, the faces of these men are now clear and distinctive.</p>
          <p>The students had these portraits made to hang in the College Portrait 
            Gallery in Nassau Hall. James Buchanan Henry and Christian Henry Scharff 
            noted this tradition in a guide they wrote for their fellow students, 
            <i>College As It Is. Or, The Collegian's Manual in 1853</i>.</p>
          &quot;It has been customary for the Senior Class, since the year 1850, 
          to have their Daguerreotypes taken for the College Picture Gallery. 
          We think this a very pretty and interesting custom for an alumnus returning 
          on a visit to Princeton years after graduation, has the satisfaction 
          of once more seeing the familiar faces of all his classmates, and of 
          perhaps showing to his pretty wife how he himself used to look when 
          a collegian. The Class sends on to Phila or New York about the month 
          of April, to secure the services of some good artist (Richards of Phila, 
          last class).&quot; 
          <p>Once the individual portraits were taken, they were placed together 
            in a frame and hung on the wall, or they were redaguerreotyped to 
            create a <a href="../photo/smallcomposite.shtml">smaller composite 
            version</a>. As Henry and Scharff note, Frederick DeBourg Richards 
            from Philadelphia took the daguerreotype portraits of the Class of 
            1852.</p>
