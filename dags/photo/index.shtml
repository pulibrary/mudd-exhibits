          <h3 align="left">The Daguerreotype</h3>
          <p>The invention of the daguerreotype was announced in France in January 
            1839 as the work of Louis Jacques Mand&eacute; Daguerre (1787-1851). 
            Soon after, news of the invention made its way to the United States, 
            and the American public responded with alacrity. The daguerreotype 
            image, developed on a silver coated copper plate, was commonly referred 
            to as the &quot;Mirror of Nature,&quot; for the surface of a daguerreotype 
            image reflects back its spectator as well as the subject pictured. 
          </p>
          <p>Generally daguerreotype plates were placed into enclosures both for 
            protection and display. A brass mat was laid on the plate to frame 
            the subject, over this a glass cover was placed, and a paper seal 
            bound these pieces together. After the mid- to late-1840s, the pieces 
            were doubly enclosed by a preserver of malleable brass. </p>

          <P>This package was then placed into a wooden or <i>papier mach&eacute;</i> 
            case, similar to those used to house miniature painted portraits. 
            To view the image one held the case in one's hand and opened it up 
            to look at the portrait or subject. The use of cases was mainly an 
            American phenomenon. In Europe it was common for daguerreotypes to 
            be placed in frames and hung on a wall. Princeton University's first 
            portrait gallery was located in Nassau Hall in what was then the Library 
            and is now the Faculty Room. In the gallery portraits of presidents, 
            faculty, and students were displayed around the perimeter of the Library, 
            seen in this photograph from circa 1871. The daguerreotype portrait 
            of the unidentified man, pictured above, may have been displayed in 
            Nassau Hall. The image has no case or frame, and it is clear that 
            at one point nails were hammered into each side of the brass preserver 
            to secure the image on a wall (nail holes are still visible on the 
            sides of the image's preserver).
