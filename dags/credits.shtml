          <p>This exhibition was curated by Melissa A. Johnson, but would not 
            have been possible without the support and assistance of a number 
            of people. The <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rbsc/friends/" target="_blank">Friends 
            of the Princeton University Library</a> and a Princeton University 
            alumnus (Alexander D. Stuart, Class of 1972) provided the funding 
            that made this work and exhibition possible. University Archivist 
            Ben Primer, and Assistant Archivists Dan Linke and John Weeren, all 
            at the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/mudd" target="_blank">Seeley 
            G. Mudd Manuscript Library</a> supported the project from the very 
            beginning. Peter Bunnell, curator of photography at <a href="http://webware.princeton.edu/artmus/" target="_blank">The 
            Art Museum Princeton University</a>, offered his valuable advice from 
            early on and was singularly instrumental in obtaining additional funds 
            without which this project could not have been carried out in its 
            entirety. Paul Messier, of <a href="http://www.bosartconserv.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Boston 
            Art Conservation</a>, agreed to take on the project as photograph 
            conservator and performed all the cleaning, resealing and conservation 
            work on these images. Ted Stanley, Head, Special Collections Conservation 
            Unit and Paper Conservator at the Princeton University Library, offered 
            valuable advice, instruction, and assistance with preservation issues, 
            rehousing of the cased images, and repair of cases. Rachel Ban, John 
            Foster and Janet Avery Dulles Fellow at the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript 
            Library, was responsible for the design and building of this web exhibition.</p>
