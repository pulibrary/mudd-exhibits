      <font size="4">Though twice defeated in the general election after winning 
      his party&#146;s nomination in the 1950s, Stevenson was still considered 
      by some, including himself, to be a possible candidate for a third run for 
      the presidency in 1960. However, John F. Kennedy&#146;s strong primary campaign 
      led to his claiming the nomination on the first ballot, locking out the 
      competition. Stevenson, who had assumed the mantle of Democratic party leadership 
      throughout the 1950s, gracefully endorsed Kennedy at the Democratic National 
      Convention. In that speech, he mocked Eisenhower&#146;s caretaker presidency, 
      made self-effacing remarks about his own political career, and extolled 
      John Kennedy&#146;s virtues. In this clip, Stevenson notes the proud history 
      of the Democratic Party as well as the hypocrisy of the 1960 Republican 
      nominee, Richard Nixon.</font></font></td>
