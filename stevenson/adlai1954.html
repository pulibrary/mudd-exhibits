<p><i>An Address by Adlai E. Stevenson ’22 to the Class of 1954</i>
<p>Princeton University—22 March 1954</center>

<p>I am informed that this senior class banquet is being held at the expense
of your accumulated reserves. I suggest that inviting me here is a very
perilous thing to do because certainly within a few hours the Republicans
will ask for equivalent time.
<p>I was delighted to witness a moment ago your emphatic approval of my
program for Princeton some thirty-two years ago—unlimited cuts, non-compulsory
Chapel, and student firing of the Dean. I always considered that it was
wise in politics to have—shall we say—a popular program. The trouble is
that when I went into politics it appears that I changed my views.
<p>I feel as though I were opening the hunting season on college seniors.
From now until mid-June, college seniors are fair game for all of us uplifters,
viewers with alarm, Chautauqua-style orators, even for occasional unemployed
politicians. From now until mid-June college seniors are to be repeatedly
reminded how fortunate they are and what they should do with their hard-won
educational disciplines; they are to be warned repeatedly that the old
order is changing, that the sky is overcast, visibility low; and they are
to be urged and goaded and implored to accept the challenge to remake the
future.
<p>Thirty-two years ago—and I might say quite a number of pounds and a
good many inches around the waist ago—when I graduated I believe I listened
to these same challenges flung down by orators whose names I have completely
forgotten. Now it is my turn to be forgotten. In doing my homework this
morning on this evening's oration, I not only let my mind run back to the
state of the world thirty-two years ago when I graduated from Princeton
but I also glanced at the <i>Nassau Herald</i> of 1922 in the hope that
I could find something about myself that would impress you. I discovered
that when my senior class voted to bestow the sobriquet of "biggest politician"
upon one of its members I received only eight votes—but when it voted on
"thinks he is biggest politician" I won second place, and that was due
to a conspiracy among my roommates.
<p>Thirty-two years ago my classmates and I graduated into a world that
was quite different from the one you enter in 1954. Before settling down
to the business of trying to earn a living, I did some more traveling.
It was a happier, more helpful world than the one I saw on a recent journey
around the globe. A terrible war to make the world safe for democracy had
just ended victoriously. A noble concept, the League of Nations, had emerged
from the chaotic aftermath of that elemental struggle. It was the twilight
of kings, the dawn of world-wide democracy. Optimism was boundless and
people proclaimed that we were on the threshold of the new era of universal
and perpetual peace and prosperity.
<p>It didn't turn out that way. It wasn't a threshold after all. Ernest
Hemingway soon wrote: "I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious,
and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes
standing in the rain almost out of earshot, so that only the shouted words
came through, and had read them, on proclamations that were slapped up
by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time, and I had
seen nothing sacred, and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago
if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it."
<p>But I don't need to tell you, a generation that was born and nurtured
in the depths of depression and came to consciousness in war and to maturity
in the confusion of world revolution—I don't need to tell you that your
elders have made something of a mess of things. Things didn't turn out
as we had thought they would in 1922 and somehow the hope and easy confidence
we felt dissolved as more and more the articulate and vocal among us doubted
their beliefs and believed their doubts.
<p>Nor do I need to enumerate for you in sepulchral tone the problems that
you face. You know them only too well. Perhaps you can solve them. I would
not presume to tell you how to do it. This university has given you the
tools with which to try. Moreover, even if I would guide you, I could not.
What a man knows at fifty that he did not know at twenty is, for the most
part, incommunicable. The laws, the aphorisms, the generalizations, the
universal truths, the parables and the old saws—all of the observations
about life which can be communicated handily in ready, verbal packages—are
as well known to a man at twenty who has been attentive as to a man at
fifty. He has been told them all, he has read them all, and he has probably
repeated them all before he graduates from college; but he has not lived
them all.
<p>What he knows at fifty that he did not know at twenty boils down to
something like this: The knowledge he has acquired with age is not the
knowledge of formulas, or forms of words, but of people, places, actions—a
knowledge not gained by words but by touch, sight, sound, victories, failures,
sleeplessness, devotion, love—the human experiences and emotions of this
earth and of oneself and other men; and perhaps, too, a little faith, and
a little reverence for things you cannot see.
<p>Nonetheless, I would speak to you not of the past, when my generation
held its hopes so high, but rather of the future, and if I cannot advise
you on how to solve the momentous problems of your future, perhaps I can
venture to suggest some duties and, if you please, some rules of conduct
that, it seems to me, devolve upon the educated man. I would speak, then,
about the educated man and his government, and about the educated man and
his university.
<p>The political organization that goes by the name of the United States
of America consists of no fewer than 155,000 governing units, school boards,
conservation districts, municipalities, states, the nation, etc. It is
operated by some one million elected officials, ranging from mosquito district
trustee to President, and by some six million full-time employees. Our
government is so large and so complicated that few understand it well and
others barely understand it at all. Yet we must try to understand it and
to make it function better.
<p>For the power, for good or evil, of this American political organization
is virtually beyond measurement. The decisions which it makes, the uses
to which it devotes its immense resources, the leadership which it provides
on moral as well as material questions, all appear likely to determine
the fate of the modern world.
<p>All this is to say that your power is virtually beyond measurement.
For it is to you, to your enlightened attention, that American government
must look for the sources of its power. You dare not, if I may say so,
withhold your attention. For if you do, if those young Americans who have
the advantage of education, perspective, and self-discipline do not participate
to the fullest extent of their ability, America will stumble, and if America
stumbles the world falls.
<p>You know that our record as citizens in recent years has been something
less than perfect. Too often our citizens have ignored their duty to their
government. Too often they have not even bothered to vote. But this is
not all. Participating in government in a democracy does not mean merely
casting a ballot on election day. It means much more than that. It means
an attitude, a moral view, and a willingness to assume a day-to-day responsibility.
How many good citizens do you know who constantly deplore waste, inefficiency,
and corruption in government, and who also go out and ring doorbells for
candidates they believe in? Not very many. Far more say, "Politics is dirty"—and
that is about their only protest about the quality of government, and far
more use the word "politician" as a term of opprobrium, disrespect, and
dishonor—and this in the land of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln. How
many respectable citizens do you know who protest loudly about the lawlessness
and venality but don't hesitate to fix a traffic ticket? And then there
are the unscrupulous for whom anything goes if it is within the letter
of the law, or at least not too far outside; the numerous kind for whom
legality and morality are synonyms. "The Fix" has become endemic in our
political life.
<p>I would remind you of an axiom of political science! People get the
kind of government they deserve. Your public servants serve you right.
Our American government may be defined, perhaps, as the government that
really cares about the people. Just so, our government demands, it depends
upon, the care and the devotion of the people.
<p>Now it is sadly true that there are corrupt officials that don't get
caught, if not as many perhaps as the cynical suspect. It is also true
that there are at every level of our government able, patient, patriotic,
devoted public servants, but all too often their reward is ingratitude,
contumely, and lately even investigation. In years gone by we required
only of our career servants, upon whom the successful operation of this
huge mechanism of government depends, that they serve at a financial sacrifice
and that they serve with little glory or public recognition. Increasingly,
it appears, we also require them to run the risk of being branded as "subversive,"
"undesirable," as "security risks." It becomes increasingly hard to attract
good men to government, and no wonder. Thoughtful men do not enjoy living
in an atmosphere of constant guerrilla warfare and suspicion.
<p>You who have spent four years on this campus know better than most people
that your greatest satisfactions, your greatest rewards, resulted from
the free interplay of ideas. You know that your most penetrating insights
resulted from the exchange and the interchange and clash of ideas. And
I would remind you that just as a great university cannot operate in any
but an atmosphere of intellectual freedom, neither can a great government.
It is the function of the democratic form of government to nurture freedom.
No less does the democratic form of government require freedom as the condition
in which it can function at all.
<p>I would suggest, then, that it is the duty of an educated man in America
today to work actively to put good men into public office—and to defend
them there against abuse and the ugly inclination we as human beings have
to believe the worst. I would suggest that it is not enough merely to vote
but that we, all of us, have the further obligation to think, and to maintain
steadfastly the rights of all men to think freely. It is always true that
when the Citizens of a democracy become apathetic, a power vacuum is created,
and corrupt men, or incompetents or worse rush in to fill it. But today
our situation is even more dangerous than that. In ordinary times the corrupt
or the incompetent can be suffered for a while and then ejected. But these
are no ordinary times. The world's fate now hangs upon how well or how
ill we in America conduct our affairs. And if a bad man is elected trustee
of a sanitary district, or if an able man in Washington is left to shift
for himself in the face of unjustified attack, then our government is diminished
by that much—and even more because others will lose heart from his example.
So you as educated, privileged people have a broad responsibility to protect
and improve what you have inherited and what you would die to preserve—the
concept of government by consent of the governed as the only tolerable
way of life.
<p>We in our country have, indeed, placed all of our faith, we have placed
all of our hopes, upon the education, the intelligence, and the understanding
of our people. We have said that ours is a government conducted by its
citizens, and from this it follows that the government will be better conducted
if its citizens are educated. It's as simple as that. We believe that the
people will find their way to the right solutions, given sufficient information.
We believe with Lincoln, "Why should there not be a patient confidence
in the ultimate justice of the people?" (although I must confess to having
entertained certain private fleeting doubts upon occasion). We have bet
all our chips, if you please, on the intellectual improvement of our people.
This is a magnificent gamble—but it is a gamble, for it raises the question
whether we have reached the awesome pinnacle of world power we now occupy
too soon, before we have sufficiently elevated our national mind to lead
the world wisely. Only the educated man entertains doubts, and doubt is
the beginning of wisdom; but doubt is not wisdom's fulfillment, and in
a time of crisis the man who doubts may fall prey to the strong dumb brute—to
the man on horseback.
<p>There is in the moiling masses of Asia a tremendous power, potentially
the greatest power on earth, and today our enemies conspire to gain the
mastery of this power. They have at their disposal, as we all know, a powerful
weapon, for Communism is a perversion of the dream of justice. And while
we see its leading attribute as the perversion, the illiterate, the toiling
masses still have their eyes fixed on the dream.
<p>We, too, have a powerful weapon, truth, and we gain our strength from
our thoughtful citizenry, which seeks and holds the truth with both its
heart and its mind. The question is, however, whether we have come to decisive
responsibility too early, before we were ready, before we had matured sufficiently.
No man can say with certainty. Personally I am optimistic and confident,
but this question will not be answered tomorrow; it will be answered in
your lifetime, and it will be answered in large part by you, the privileged
American.
<p>If I have made your tasks and your responsibilities sound formidable,
which indeed they are, may I also remind you that this is what makes the
prospects of your careers so exciting. There is a wonderful passage in
Emerson—and happily I couldn't lay my hands on it—I'll spare you from it.
I hope sometime you will read that essay. It says the time to live is not
when everything is serene, but when all is tumult—when the old admits being
compared with the new. This is the time of early morning, when it is fresh
and exciting. I think this is your generation, I cannot be sure. Change
is the order of life and difficulties its meat. You live in a time of historic
change and of infinite difficulty. But do not let the difficulties distract
you. Face the problems of your time you must, deal with them you must.
But do not allow the alarms and excursions and partisanship of our political
scene to distract you, do not let even the awful problems of the Atomic
Age claim all your attention. Dare, rather, to live your lives fully, boldly;
dare to study and to learn to cultivate the mind and the spirit, even though
it isn't fashionable in your community. For though our people become prosperous
as never before and though our foreign policy triumphs, these things are
but instruments of the proper purpose, the higher purpose, of Western man—the
cultivation of the mind and of the spirit.
<p>It would be presumptuous, and out of character, for me to lecture you
about your spirit. That I must leave to wiser, and to better men. But perhaps
you'll forgive me if I draw on what experiences I have had I have not always
been an unemployed politician, you know—to say a word about intelligence
and experience as attributes of the good judgment you will need—the good
sense, if you please.
<p>Don't be afraid to learn; to read, to study, to work, to try to know,
because at the very best you can know very little. And don't above all
things be afraid to think for yourself. Nothing has been, in my judgment,
more disheartening about the contemporary scene the last several years
in America than the growth of the popularity of unreason—of anti-intellectualism.
One thinks of those chanting, screaming crowds that walked over precipices
in Germany—and not so long ago. The conformists abominate thought. Thinking
implies disagreement and disagreement implies non-conformity and non-conformity
implies heresy and heresy implies disloyalty. So obviously thinking must
be stopped. This is the routine. But I say to you that bawling is not a
substitute for thinking and that reason is not the subversion but the salvation
of freedom. And don't be afraid of unpopular positions, of driving upstream.
All progress has resulted from people who took unpopular positions. All
change is the result of a change in the contemporary state of mind. Don't
be afraid of being out of tune with your environment, and above all pray
God that you are not afraid to live, to live hard and fast. To my way of
thinking it is not the years in your life but the life in your years that
count in the long run. You'll have more fun, you'll do more and you'll
get more, you'll give more satisfaction the more you know, the more you
have worked, and the more you have lived. For yours is a great adventure
at a stirring time in the annals of men.
<p>"University" is a proud, a noble and ancient word. Around it cluster
all of the values and the traditions which civilized people have for centuries
prized more highly. The idea which underlies this university—any university—is
greater than any of its physical manifestations; its classrooms, its laboratories,
its clubs, its athletic plant, even the particular groups of faculty and
students who make up its human element as of any given time. What is this
idea? It is that the highest condition of man in this mysterious universe
is the freedom of the spirit. And it is only truth that can set the spirit
free.
<p>The function of a university is, then, the search for truth and its
communication to succeeding generations. Only as that function is performed
steadfastly, conscientiously, and without interference, does the university
realize its underlying purpose. Only so does the university keep faith
with the great humanist tradition of which it is a part. Only so does it
merit the honorable name that it bears.
<p>When you depart, think occasionally upon your university's inherent
ideas and purposes, as its outward trappings recede. Don't forget that
Princeton is a university, as well as your university; and that it has
obligations to the whole of mankind not just to you—obligations which it
can neither ignore nor shirk, and which cannot, consistently with its honorable
name and its place in the community of scholarship, be sacrificed to passing
passions and prejudices.
<p>The right to the serene pursuit of truth did not descend like manna
from heaven; it was won by hard fighting, and the fight goes on and on
to the end of time—even as the struggle between good and evil. In this
continuing battle for freedom, Princeton and her sister universities are
at the farthest front, and so should you be who are Princeton's children.
As the archive of the Western mind, as the keeper of Western culture, the
university has an obligation to transmit from one generation to the next
the heritage of freedom—for freedom is the foundation of Western culture.
As graduates of this university, as individuals who have made in it an
investment of the golden, irretrievable years of your lives, you have an
obligation to oppose the efforts of anyone, for whatever reason or in the
service of whatever interest, to divert Princeton or any sister institution
from her classic objective. If you are to be true to your democratic traditions
and realize your own best selves you cannot, I suggest, do less.
<p>And I hope you will carry away with you some of the wise serenity of
the timeless courage, the unhurried objectivity which is the atmosphere
of Princeton and which represents the collective imprint of its founders,
students, and teachers who have gone before you.
<p>I came here last night in darkness, after an absence of four or five
years. I came with an old friend, an old classmate. We drove a little through
the campus, after dusk. It was soft, the air fresh with the beginning of
spring. I thought of some words that I read here long ago, written by the
English poet, Alfred Noyes, who stayed for a time on the Princeton campus.
They went something like this if I am not mistaken:
<p><i>Now lamp-lit gardens in the blue dusk shine</i>
<br><i>Through dogwood red and white,</i>
<br><i>And round the gray quadrangles, line by line,</i>
<br><i>The windows fill with light,</i>
<br><i>Where Princeton calls to Magdalen, tower to tower,</i>
<br><i>Twin lanthorns of the law,</i>
<br><i>And those cream-white magnolia boughs embower</i>
<br><i>The halls of old Nassau.</i>
<p>Sentimental? Yes. Nostalgic? Perhaps. Yet beautiful, true. Your days
are short here; this is the last of your springs. And now in the serenity
and quiet of this lovely place, touch the depths of truth, feel the hem
of Heaven. You will go away with old, good friends. And don't forget when
you leave why you came.
