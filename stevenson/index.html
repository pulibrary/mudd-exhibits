<h2 align="center"><i>A Voice of Conscience: The Legacy of Adlai Stevenson</i></h2>

<p align="center">Exhibition at the Mudd Library<br>
September 11, 2000 - February 15, 2001<br>

<p>In the centennial year of his birth, Adlai E. Stevenson is
remembered for his
contributions to public life: governor of Illinois, Democratic presidential condidate, and
United Nations ambassador. In addition, this Princeton University graduate of the Class of
1922 served as a voice of conscience in both domestic and foreign policy
during the years
that followed World War II. Known for his wit and erudition in an era famous for
blandness, Stevenson, in the words of Alistair Cooke, &quot;remains the liveliest reminder
of our time that there are admirable reasons for failing to be president.&quot; While not
tasting the fruits of personal victory, his ideas became reality during the presidential
administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He spoke his heart and mind, and
in doing so, won the admiration of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Drawing chiefly on the wealth of photographs, documents, recorded material, and
memorabilia in the Adlai Stevenson Papers at Princeton University's Seeley G. Mudd
Manuscript Library, the exhibition reveals both the private and public facets of
Stevenson's eventful life: from confident pronouncements on issues of national importance
to moments of anxious introspection. The story of Stevenson's life, which began in Los
Angeles on February 5, 1900, and ended in London on July 14, 1965, is
vividly chronicled as
visitors pass through the stages of Stevenson's life. Beginning with the early influences
of his life, Stevenson seemed destined for public service as the exhibit
illustrates
his political and journalistic roots. Stevenson's entr&eacute;e in
politics
as
governor of Illinois, and his later losses in the elections of 1952 and
1956 are detailed.
The exhibit also explores the last and sometimes trying chapter of Stevenson's career,
when, at John F. Kennedy's request, he assumed the role of United States Ambassador to the
United Nations.</p>

<p>Rounding out the exhibit are two important audiovisual components: a condensed version
of Andrew Schlesinger's 1990 PBS documentary narrated by Gregory Peck, entitled
&quot;Adlai Stevenson: The Man from Libertyville,&quot; and an interactive presentation of
political commercials, interviews, speeches, and other material that captures Stevenson in
the act of reaching out to his fellow citizens. Although he could not persuade a majority
to accept his vision of a &quot;New America&quot; and elect him president,
Stevenson's
ideas took root in many parts of the country, and some of his program
was later
enacted into law, leaving a practical and moral legacy that still
endures. </p>
