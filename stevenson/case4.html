<h2>Election of 1956: <strong><em>&quot;There may be crazier ways to select a President
but I can't think of one.&quot;</em></strong></h2>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Stevenson announced his candidacy for the 1956
Democratic presidential nomination in
    November 1955. This time, competition from Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver and New York
    Governor W. Averell Harriman forced Stevenson to campaign more
aggressively for the
    nomination. After winning the nomination, Stevenson waged a vigorous presidential
    campaign, delivering 300 speeches and traveling 55,000 miles. He called on the electorate
    to join him on a march to a &quot;new America,&quot; based on a liberal agenda that
    anticipated the programs of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.</td>

    <td width="50%">Upon securing the nomination, Stevenson deferred to 
     convention
    delegates to select his running mate. Stevenson favored Massachusetts Senator John F.
    Kennedy, but the delegates chose Estes Kefauver&nbsp;by a narrow margin. Here, Truman,
    Stevenson, Harriman, and Kefauver celebrate Stevenson's nomination at the 1956 Democratic
    National Convention. </td>

    <td width="50%">Much to Stevenson's dismay, at the convention Truman
supported Averell
    Harriman for the 1956 Democratic ticket. This final page of a letter
Truman sent
    Stevenson acknowledges the acrimony Truman's support for Harriman
might have caused, while
    putting in perspective the need to win the election above all else.<br clear="all">

    <td width="50%">While President Eisenhower suffered heart problems, the economy enjoyed
    robust health. Stevenson's hopes for victory were dashed when, in October, President
    Eisenhower's doctors gave him a clean bill of health and the Suez crisis erupted. The
    public was not convinced that a change in leadership was needed, and Stevenson lost his
    second bid for the presidency, though not the respect of his fellow citizens. <br
