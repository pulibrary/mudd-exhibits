    <td width="50%">President Truman approached Stevenson early in 1952, suggesting he seek
    the Democratic presidential nomination. Stevenson refused, stating that he preferred to
    continue his work in Illinois. Stevenson's hesitancy to run for the nomination became
    fodder for much political satire. Characteristically, Stevenson quipped, &quot;I spend an
    awful lot of time reading about myself in papers and magazines these days. The awful thing
    is, I can't say I mind it much either.&quot;</td>

    <td width="50%">Chicago hosted the 1952 Democratic National Convention in late July. As
    governor of the host state, Stevenson opened the convention. Five days later, the
    delegates drafted him as the party's candidate for president. Stevenson delivered his
    acceptance speech in the early morning hours of July 26, saying, &quot;Let's talk sense to
    the American people. Let's tell them the truth, that there are no gains without
    pains.&quot; <em><br clear="all">
