    Lewis Green Stevenson never held an elected office, but served as Secretary of State of
    Illinois and was considered a strong contender for the Democratic vice-presidential

    While at Choate, he served as business manager of <i>The News</i>, and
was elected

Stevenson (far left) was chosen
    managing editor of <i>The Daily Princetonian</i>. When an ownership
dispute left the 
    ownership of <i>The Daily Pantagraph</i> uncertain, Stevenson left
Harvard Law School to work for
    the family paper. He served as a member of the board of directors for
<i>The Pantagraph</i> most
