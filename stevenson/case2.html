    <td width="58%" align="top">Stevenson initially considered
    running for the Senate in 1947, but decided to challenge incumbent
Illinois Governor Dwight
    Green in 1948. Stevenson, a political newcomer, surprised many by
winning the
election by over half a million votes, the
    largest majority in Illinois history.</td>

    <td width="50%">Stevenson, believing he had failed as a husband and father, wanted to
    succeed as Governor. He set an impressive record, putting in long hours in his basement
    office in the Governor's Mansion---even answering the telephone himself after hours.
    Stevenson cracked down on gambling, democratized civil service, and supported highway
    improvements. His refusal to succumb to the paranoia of the
&quot;Anxious Age,&quot; as he
    called McCarthyism, haunted him in his future political
endeavors.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Governor Stevenson at the State Fairgrounds, Springfield, Illinois, where
    he officially opened the 1950 Illinois State Fair by setting off fireworks. Stevenson was
    a popular public speaker, gaining a reputation as an intellectual, with a self-deprecating
    sense of humor to match. </td>

    <td width="50%">As part of United Nations week, Governor Stevenson accepts a United
    Nations flag from the Springfield Chapter of the Navy Mothers of America. Stevenson
    participated in the organization of the fledgling international congress that became the
    United Nations. In 1947, President Harry Truman appointed Stevenson to the Second Session
    of the United Nations General Assembly. </td>

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">Governor Stevenson signs the document declaring
February 17-24, 1952,
    Brotherhood Week. Stevenson believed that &quot;every age needs men who will redeem the
    time by living with a vision of things that are to be.&quot; Newton Minow, one of
    Stevenson's law partners, commented that Stevenson &quot;set the pattern for civil
    rights... his thought became law and policy later.&quot; </td>

    <td width="50%">At the annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner on March 29, 1952, Truman announced
    that he would not seek reelection.&nbsp; Reporters besieged Stevenson, asking if he were a
    candidate. Two weeks later, he issued a formal statement that he would
not seek the presidential
    nomination. At the Democratic National Convention, however, Stevenson allowed himself to
    be drafted as the party's candidate for president, stating, &quot;to shirk, to evade, to
    decline, would be to repay honor with dishonor.&quot; </td>
